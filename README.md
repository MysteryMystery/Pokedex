#Pokedex

##Plan
###Data Storage
Using PokeAPI, save a JSON representation of each pokemon searched.

The save folder will contain many JSON files, where one file represents one pokemon and named \<numeric ID>_\<name>.

This allows for the searching to be done by both file walking and when the pokemon is selected, load the file.
